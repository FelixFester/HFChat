# HFChat
HTML chat page that is using API from HuggingFace.

## What it doing
It allows you to chat with AI models from HuggingFace by using their API, so you'll need API key to take a look at how it works. By default page is using blenderbot-400M-distill, but you can add your own link that must start with "api-inference.huggingface.co/models/...". Just keep in mind what HuggingFace have limitations especially when it comes to free usage.
